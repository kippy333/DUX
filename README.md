## Introduction

PeerMentor is a student-driven website designed to bridge the gap between students seeking academic support and experienced peers who can offer the support. Aimed at university students aged 18-22, especially those in first year (level 4). PeerMentor connects users with mentors who have successfuly completed relevant modules and are available for affordable, one-on-one tutoring.

With features such as mentor profiles, subject based searching, mobile accessibility and a built-in messaging system, PeerMentor makes finding the right help simple, inclusive and effective.

### Design Choices -'change as per your needs include old and revised wireframes '

![color pallette]('path to the image file for your colour pallet here')

- I will be using white colour text against the blue background colours.
  - this combination was chosen to ensure high readability and meet WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards.

  - **typography**
  - A clean, sans font has been used throughout to ensure legibility, font sizes are large and easy to read.

  - **Structure**
    - The site uses consistent layout with clearly seperated sections for navigation, content and interactions. 

  - **Imagery**
    -  bootstrap, https://icons.getbootstrap.com/

  - **Wireframes**
    - Initial wireframes were designed with accessibility in mind but lacked some consistency and mobile responsiveness. Based on feedback, revisions were made to improve clarity.
